# BUILDING A DATABASE SERVICE

Design a database service class that provides the ability for developers to query the MySQL database and create an example site that interfaces with the database using the following classes.

### Assignment Requirements
1. Create a database class that can query the MySQL database. The class must accept connection-related information and build a PDO instance stored in the class.
2. Developers use the services of each SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, and the method of enabling this should be as simple as possible.
3. The data to be imported must be returned to the array of results.
4. Methods for storing, updating, or deleting data must return true if the query is successful, otherwise false.
5. The database must contain at least four tables and at least one table is related to another table using an ID.
6. Database services should be used to create simple sites that can read, store, update, and delete data from databases.
7. All codes created should be annotated explaining the function and explaining what happens.
